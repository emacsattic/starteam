;;   This file implements many of the features of VC for use with
;;   StarTeam (www.starbase.com), a source control program.
;;
;;
;;   ^X-v-v    - Do next action:
;;	Current ->     Display the message "Up to Date"
;;	Out of Date -> Do a check out
;;	Merge ->       Run emerge
;;	Modified ->    Checkin with a comment
;;   ^X-v-l    - Get a history of the file
;;   ^X-v-=    - Do an ediff on the contents of the current buffer with
;;               the latest version in source control
;;   ^X-v-d    - Get a status of all files in the current directory
;;   ^X-v-^I   - Get a list of files to check in in for a directory and all sub directories
;;   ^X-v-^O   - Get a list of files to check out in for a directory and all sub directories
;;   ^X-v-^L   - Lock the file
;;   ^X-v-^U   - Unlock the file
;;
;; Configuration:
;;
;; At a minimum you need to set the following:
;;
;;   (setq starteam-host "10.42.42.2"   ; or "myMachine.myCompany.com"
;;         starteam-executable "stcmd"
;;         starteam-to-directory-alist (list (cons  "^/export/home/username/working"  "src/src" )))
;;
;; You will need to customize starteam-to-directory-alist to your
;; particular Starteam projects; see the doc comments for more
;; details on the structure of this variable.
;;
;; In addition, there are also several other variables that configure
;; the behavior of starteam.el:
;;
;;    starteam-dired-mode-name
;;    starteam-port
;;    starteam-user
;;    starteam-password
;;    starteam-keep-unlocked-files-read-only
;;    starteam-unlock-after-checkin
;;    starteam-switch-to-output
;;    starteam-debug
;;    starteam-post-checkin-functions
;;
;; Users may also wish to call 
;;  
;;    starteam-menubar-setup 
;;
;; to add a STARTEAM menu to the main menu bar. 

;;; History:
;;
;; 0.1    [Matthew O. Smith <m0smith at yahoo dot com>] 
;;        A good first cut
;;
;; 0.2    [Matthew O. Smith] 
;;        Works on a Solaris box
;;
;; 0.3    [Christopher J. Kline <chris at nearlife dot com>] 08 May 2001 
;;        Many changes:
;;           - Matthew Smith's company no longer uses Starteam; Chris Kline taking 
;;             over maintenance
;;           - Improved documentation on variables and methods
;;           - Added configurable option to keep unlocked files read-only (check-out 
;;             also honors this option)
;;           - Added configurable option to unlock files after check-in
;;           - Added configurable option for debugging (echoes each command-line 
;;             operation to *Messages*)
;;           - Behavior of buffer-switching to output of query operations (e.g., 
;;             getting file history) is now configurable via starteam-switch-to-output
;;           - Added starteam-unlock-file
;;           - Added starteam-menubar-setup to add STARTEAM menu to main menubar
;;           - Check for failure of most operations, output descriptive error messages
;;           - If check-out fails, reason is given and option to force check-out is 
;;             presented
;;           - Most operations now fail gracefully on common failure conditions 
;;             (usually when buffer file cannot be reconciled with 
;;             starteam-to-directory-alist)
;;           - Functions now restore current-buffer to original state before exiting
;;             (except starteam-actual-buffer-current-activity; see "Known Bugs")
;;           - Consolidated redundant code
;;
;; 0.4    [Christopher J. Kline] 09 May 2001         
;;        - starteam-perform-lock-operation now checks to make sure
;;          that the operation succeeded; if it does not, will try to
;;          provide an explanation of why the operation failed
;;        - changed (file (buffer-name buf)) to 
;;          (file (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name buf))) in
;;          starteam-current-buffer-dir-and-file so that file name
;;          returned is based on the file associated with the buffer
;;          instead of the buffer name (fixed previous bug which
;;          prevented operations from working when the 'uniquify'
;;          package was operating)
;;
;; 0.5    [Christopher J. Kline] 21 June 2001         
;;        - fixed bug in starteam-dired-mode where "Unknown" status
;;          or a "-" in the file mode would cause a "no file this line" 
;;          error 
;;
;; 0.6    [Matthew O. Smith] 08 May 2002
;;        - added starteam-checkout-dir-recursive
;;        - Chris Kline no longer has access to Starteam, and Matthew Smith has
;;          resumed using it, so Matthew is taking over maintenance of starteam.el
;; 0.7
;;        - Added support for cygwin under XEmacs
;;        - Various changes made by Knut Forkalsrud.

;; To do:
;;    - Have Merge do an optional checkin
;;    - Have get-directory enter a dired type mode
;;    - Integrate fully into vc-mode menus
;;
;; Known bugs:
;;    - Merge checks in the wrong file (disabled merge menu option
;;      until this is tested and fixed)
;;    - When in dired mode, some operations (getting status, locking,
;;      unlocking) switch the current buffer to the
;;      output-buffer. This should not happen, and is a side-effect of
;;      starteam-actual-buffer-current-activity's reliance on
;;      'find-file when in starteam-dired-mode

The elements in the starteam-to-directory-alist are of the form:

   (cons  \"^PROJECT_WORKING_FOLDER\"  \"PROJECTNAME/VIEWNAME\")

The PROJECT_WORKING_FOLDER can be found in the Win32 StarTeam
client by opening a project and choosing \"Properties\" from the
\"View\" menu; the current value in the \"Working folder\" section is
what you should use as PROJECT_WORKING_FOLDER

For example, assume that the working folder for the \"Main\" view in
the \"TopSecret\" project is set to \"C:/Starteam/TSMain\". The entry
for this looks like the following:

   (cons  \"^C:/Starteam/TSMain\"  \"TopSecret/Main\" )

The VIEWNAME is NOT hierarchical, even when the view is a child
of another view. For example, if \"Branch_A\" view is a child
of the \"Main\" view in the \"TopSecret\" project, its VIEWNAME
is \"Branch_A\", not \"Main/Branch_A\":

   (cons  \"^C:/Starteam/temp/branchA\"  \"TopSecret/Branch_A\" )

Branch_A view has been set to \"C:/Starteam/temp/branchA\")
